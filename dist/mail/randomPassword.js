Blessed is the man

who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,

or set foot on the path of sinners,

or sit in the seat of mockers.

2But his delight is in the Law of the LORD,

and on His law he meditates day and night.

3He is like a tree planted by streams of water,

yielding its fruit in season,

whose leaf does not wither,

and who prospers in all he does.

4Not so the wicked!

For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.

5Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,

nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

6For the LORD guards the path of the righteous,

but the way of the wicked will perish.



Psalm 
Psalm 	
The Triumphant Messiah
(Acts :23–31)

1Why do the nations ragea

and the peoples plot in vain?

2The kings of the earth take their stand

and the rulers gather together,

against the LORD

and against His Anointed One:b

3“Let us break Their chains

and cast away Their cords.”

4The One enthroned in heaven laughs;

the Lord taunts them.

5Then He rebukes them in His anger,

and terrifies them in His fury:

6“I have installed My King on Zion,

upon My holy mountain.”

7I will proclaim the decree

spoken to Me by the LORD:

“You are My Son;

today I have become Your Father.c

8Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance,

the ends of the earth Your possession.

9You will break themd with an iron scepter;

You will shatter them like pottery.e”

Therefore be wise, O kings;

be admonished, O judges of the earth.

Serve the LORD with fear,

and rejoice with trembling.

Kiss the Son, lest He be angry

and you perish in your rebellion,

when His wrath ignites in an instant.

Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.




Deliver Me, O LORD!


1A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.

1O LORD, how my foes have increased!

How many rise up against me!

2Many say of me,

“God will not deliver him.”

Selaha

3But You, O LORD, are a shield around me,

my glory, and the One who lifts my head.

4To the LORD I cry aloud,

and He answers me from His holy mountain.

Selah

5I lie down and sleep;

I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.

6I will not fear the myriads

set against me on every side.

7Arise, O LORD!

Save me, O my God!

Strike all my enemies on the jaw;

break the teeth of the wicked.

8Salvation belongs to the LORD;

may Your blessing be on Your people.

Selah

Psalm 	
Answer Me When I Call!

1For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

1Answer me when I call,

O God of my righteousness!

You have relieved my distress;

show me grace and hear my prayer.

2How long, O men, will my honor be maligned?

How long will you love vanity and seek after liesa?

Selah

3Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself;

the LORD hears when I call to Him.

4Be angry, yet do not sin;b

on your bed, search your heart and be still.

Selah

5Offer the sacrifices of the righteous

and trust in the LORD.

6Many ask, “Who can show us the good?”

Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.

7You have filled my heart with more joy

than when grain and new wine abound.

8I will lie down and sleep in peace,

for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

Psalm 	
Give Ear to My Words

1For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David.

1Give ear to my words, O LORD;

consider my groaning.

2Attend to the sound of my cry,

my King and my God,

for to You I pray.

3In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice;

at daybreak I lay my plea before You

and wait in expectation.

4For You are not a God who delights in wickedness;

no evil can dwell with You.

5The boastful cannot stand in Your presence;

You hate all workers of iniquity.

6You destroy those who tell lies;

the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.

7But I will enter Your house

by the abundance of Your loving devotion;a

in reverence I will bow down

toward Your holy temple.

8Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness

because of my enemies;

make straight Your way before me.

9For not a word they speak can be trusted;

destruction lies within them.

Their throats are open graves;

their tongues practice deceit.b

10Declare them guilty, O God;

let them fall by their own devices.

Drive them out for their many transgressions,

for they have rebelled against You.

11But let all who take refuge in You rejoice;

let them ever shout for joy.

May You shelter them,

that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.

12For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous;

You surround them with the shield of Your favor.

Psalm 	
Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger
(Psalm :1–22)

1For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith.a A Psalm of David.

1O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger

or discipline me in Your wrath.

2Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail;

heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.

3My soul is deeply distressed.

How long, O LORD, how long?

4Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul;

save me because of Your loving devotion.

5For there is no mention of You in death;

who can praise You from Sheol?

6I am weary from groaning;

all night I flood my bed with weeping

and drench my couch with tears.

7My eyes fail from grief;

they grow dim because of all my foes.

8Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,

for the LORD has heard my weeping.

9The LORD has heard my cry for mercy;

the LORD accepts my prayer.

10All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed;

they will turn back in sudden disgrace.

Psalm 
Psalm 	
I Take Refuge in You

1A Shiggaiona of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite.

1O LORD my God, I take refuge in You;

save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,

2or they will shred my soul like a lion

and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me.

3O LORD my God, if I have done this,

if injustice is on my hands,

4if I have rewarded my allyb with evil,

if I have plundered my foe without cause,

5then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me;

may he trample me to the ground

and leave my honor in the dust.

Selah

6Arise, O LORD, in Your anger;

rise up against the fury of my enemies.

Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.

7Let the assembled peoples gather around You;

take Your seat over them on high.

8The LORD judges the peoples;

vindicate me, O LORD,

according to my righteousness and integrity.

9Put an end to the evil of the wicked,

but establish the righteous,

O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.c

10My shield is with God,

who saves the upright in heart.

11God is a righteous judge

and a God who feels indignation each day.

12If one does not repent,

God will sharpen His sword;

He has bent and strung His bow.

13He has prepared His deadly weapons;

He ordains His arrows with fire.

14Behold, the wicked man travails with evil;

he conceives trouble and births falsehood.

15He has dug a hole and hollowed it out;

he has fallen into a pit of his own making.

16His trouble recoils on himself,

and his violence falls on his own head.

17I will thank the LORD for His righteousness

and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
